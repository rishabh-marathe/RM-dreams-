1. **What is Input and Output Stream in Java?**
Ans: **InputStream**: A class used to read data from a source (like a file or network) in bytes.
- **OutputStream**: A class used to write data to a destination (like a file or network) in bytes.
Both are part of Java's I/O package (`java.io`) and serve as the foundation for byte-based I/O operations.

2. **What are the Methods of OutputStream?**
Ans: Key methods of the `OutputStream` class:
   - **write(int b)**: Writes the specified byte to the output stream.
   - **write(byte[] b)**: Writes a byte array to the output stream.
   - **flush()**: Forces any buffered output to be written out.
   - **close()**: Closes the stream and releases system resources.

3. **What is Serialization in Java?**
Ans: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be easily stored in a file or transmitted over a network. It allows objects to be persisted or transferred between different environments.

4. **What is the Serializable Interface in Java?**
Ans: The `Serializable` interface marks a class as capable of being serialized. A class must implement this interface for its objects to be converted into a byte stream.

   **Example**:

   public class Person implements Serializable {
       private String name;
       private int age;
   }

5. **What is Deserialization in Java?**
Ans: Deserialization is the process of converting a byte stream back into an object. It reverses the process of serialization, restoring the objectâ€™s state from a byte stream.

6. **How is Serialization Achieved in Java?**
Ans: Serialization is achieved by using `ObjectOutputStream` to write an object to a file or stream. The class of the object must implement the `Serializable` interface.

   **Example**:
   
   FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("person.ser");
   ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
   out.writeObject(person);
   out.close();

7. **How is Deserialization Achieved in Java?**
Ans: Deserialization is achieved using `ObjectInputStream` to read the object from a byte stream or file.

   **Example**:

   FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("person.ser");
   ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
   Person person = (Person) in.readObject();
   in.close();

8. **How Can You Avoid Certain Member Variables of a Class from Getting Serialized?**
Ans: To prevent a member variable from being serialized, mark it with the `transient` keyword. This tells the Java serialization mechanism to ignore that field.

   **Example**:
 
   public class Person implements Serializable {
       private String name;
       private transient int age; // 'age' will not be serialized
   }
  
9. **What Classes Are Available in the Java IO File Classes API?**
Ans: Common classes in the Java I/O file API include:
   - **File**: Represents a file or directory.
   - **FileInputStream**: Reads bytes from a file.
   - **FileOutputStream**: Writes bytes to a file.
   - **FileReader**: Reads characters from a file.
   - **FileWriter**: Writes characters to a file.
   - **BufferedReader**: Reads text from a character input stream, buffering characters for efficient reading.

10. **What is the Difference Between `Externalizable` and `Serializable` Interface?**
Ans: Serializable: A marker interface that allows an object to be serialized. The default serialization process is handled by the JVM.
   - **Externalizable**: Extends `Serializable` and allows you to control the serialization and deserialization process by implementing `writeExternal()` and `readExternal()` methods.

Key Difference: `Externalizable` gives full control over serialization and deserialization, while `Serializable` relies on default mechanisms provided by the Java runtime.
